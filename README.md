## Introduction

This repository serves as a resource for anyone interested in learning about data structures and algorithms. The code examples are implemented in various programming languages and are designed to help you understand the concepts and how they work.

## Data Structures

In the `data_structures` directory, you will find implementations of popular data structures, including:

- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
- Graphs

Each data structure has its own subdirectory containing the implementation code and explanations of how the data structure functions.

## Algorithms

The `algorithms` directory contains implementations of common algorithms, such as:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion Examples

Just like the data structures, each algorithm has its own subdirectory with the code and explanations.
